# Feature Specification: Merge CI.yml into Workflow.yml

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a PowerShell module maintainer using the Process-PSModule framework, I want a single reusable workflow file that intelligently handles pull requests (with optional preview publishing), merged releases (with full publishing), and scheduled/manual test runs (without publishing), so that my repository configuration is simpler with fewer workflow files to maintain and the Nightly-Run.yml workflow is no longer needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a pull request is opened, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** all build/test/lint jobs execute and publish jobs run but skip publishing unless the PR has a "preview" label
2. **Given** a pull request with "preview" label is opened, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** the full pipeline executes including module and documentation publishing to preview environments
3. **Given** a pull request is merged to main, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** the full pipeline executes including module publishing to PowerShell Gallery and documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
4. **Given** the workflow is triggered by workflow_dispatch or schedule (nightly), **When** the workflow runs, **Then** all build/test/lint jobs execute but publish jobs (Publish-Site, Publish-Module) are skipped
5. **Given** test jobs fail during execution, **When** the workflow continues, **Then** code coverage aggregation and test result summarization still complete successfully
6. **Given** a repository currently uses both Process-PSModule.yml and Nightly-Run.yml, **When** migrated to the unified workflow, **Then** only Process-PSModule.yml is needed with workflow_dispatch and schedule triggers added

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a pull request is created? ‚Üí Should run full pipeline including publish jobs, but publish jobs contain logic to skip unless PR has "preview" label
- What happens when a pull request is merged to main? ‚Üí Should run full pipeline including all publishing steps
- How does the system handle test failures? ‚Üí Should continue to completion, including code coverage and test result summarization (existing behavior)
- What happens when triggered by workflow_dispatch or schedule (nightly run)? ‚Üí Should run all build/test/lint jobs but skip publishing steps (replaces separate Nightly-Run.yml workflow)
- What happens if a repository only needs CI functionality? ‚Üí Not applicable - all repositories using Process-PSModule run the full workflow

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve all job definitions from CI.yml (Get-Settings, Build-Module, Build-Docs, Build-Site, Test-SourceCode, Lint-SourceCode, Test-Module, Test-ModuleLocal, BeforeAll-ModuleLocal, AfterAll-ModuleLocal, Get-TestResults, Get-CodeCoverage)
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all job definitions from workflow.yml (all jobs from CI.yml plus Publish-Site and Publish-Module)
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain identical input parameters as defined in both workflows (Name, SettingsPath, Debug, Verbose, Version, Prerelease, WorkingDirectory)
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain identical secrets definitions as defined in both workflows (APIKey, TEST_APP_ENT_CLIENT_ID, TEST_APP_ENT_PRIVATE_KEY, TEST_APP_ORG_CLIENT_ID, TEST_APP_ORG_PRIVATE_KEY, TEST_USER_ORG_FG_PAT, TEST_USER_USER_FG_PAT, TEST_USER_PAT)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support workflow_dispatch trigger to allow manual workflow execution
- **FR-006**: System MUST support schedule trigger for nightly automated test runs
- **FR-007**: Publish-Site job MUST execute when a pull request is merged to main and all prerequisite jobs succeed
- **FR-008**: Publish-Module job MUST execute when a pull request is merged to main and all prerequisite jobs succeed
- **FR-009**: Publish-Site job MUST execute when a pull request has the "preview" label and is not merged
- **FR-010**: Publish-Module job MUST execute when a pull request has the "preview" label and is not merged (with preview/prerelease publishing logic)
- **FR-011**: Publish-Site and Publish-Module jobs MUST be skipped when triggered via workflow_dispatch or schedule
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain all job dependencies and execution order as defined in the original workflows
- **FR-013**: System MUST continue executing code coverage and test result jobs even when test jobs fail
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain all conditional logic for job execution (if conditions) from both workflows
- **FR-015**: Repositories using Process-PSModule MUST be able to reference a single workflow file for all execution modes (PR, merge, scheduled, manual)
- **FR-016**: CI.yml file MUST be removed after successful migration to prevent confusion
- **FR-017**: Nightly-Run.yml workflow in module repositories MUST be removed as its functionality is absorbed into the unified workflow
- **FR-018**: Unified workflow MUST use write permissions (contents: write, pull-requests: write, statuses: write, pages: write, id-token: write) to support all execution modes

### Key Entities

- **CI.yml Workflow**: GitHub Actions reusable workflow file that currently handles continuous integration tasks (build, test, lint) with read-only permissions, used by Nightly-Run.yml for scheduled testing
- **workflow.yml Workflow**: GitHub Actions reusable workflow file that handles full pipeline including CI tasks plus publishing (site deployment, module publishing) with write permissions, used for pull request workflows
- **Nightly-Run.yml**: Repository-level workflow in module repos that triggers CI.yml on a schedule or manual dispatch for testing without publishing
- **Process-PSModule.yml**: Repository-level workflow in module repos that triggers workflow.yml for pull request and merge operations
- **Job Definitions**: Reusable workflow jobs that perform specific operations (Get-Settings, Build-Module, Test-Module, etc.)
- **Publish Jobs**: Publish-Site and Publish-Module jobs that deploy documentation and modules, with conditional execution based on trigger type and PR labels
- **Trigger Types**: Different invocation methods (pull_request opened/synchronized, pull_request merged, workflow_dispatch, schedule) that determine which jobs execute
- **Preview Label**: Pull request label that enables preview publishing for testing changes before merge
- **Permissions**: GitHub Actions permission sets that control what the workflow can do (write permissions needed for all modes)

**Feature Branch**: `002-merge-ci-yml`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Merge ci.yml into workflow.yml, so that we can deduplicate and two workflows and have less workflows in the repos that use this process."

## Execution Flow (main)

1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description is clear: consolidate two similar workflow files
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: PowerShell module maintainers, CI/CD pipeline
   ‚Üí Actions: Merge workflows, deduplicate configuration, reduce workflow count
   ‚Üí Data: Workflow YAML files, job definitions, permissions
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must maintain existing functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major ambiguities; requirements are well-defined
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary user flow: Repository using Process-PSModule framework references a single workflow
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements focus on workflow consolidation and preservation of functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí CI.yml workflow, workflow.yml, job definitions, permissions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included; focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
