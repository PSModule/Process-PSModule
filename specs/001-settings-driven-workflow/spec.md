# Feature Specification: Settings-Driven Workflow Configuration

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a workflow maintainer, I want a single, centralized configuration source that defines all workflow settings and parameters, so that the workflow structure is simplified and the complexity of conditional if: statements is significantly reduced. This central configuration should eliminate scattered hardcoded values and make the workflow logic more maintainable and easier to understand.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a workflow with multiple conditional branches based on hardcoded values, **When** configuration is centralized in a single source, **Then** the number of if: statements decreases by at least 50% and logic becomes more readable
2. **Given** configuration changes are needed, **When** I update the central configuration file, **Then** all dependent workflow steps automatically use the new values without individual modifications
3. **Given** a new workflow parameter is introduced, **When** I add it to the central configuration, **Then** it becomes immediately available to all workflow steps without code changes
4. **Given** environment-specific settings are required, **When** I define them in the central configuration, **Then** the workflow can access them through simple variable references instead of complex conditionals

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the central configuration file is missing or invalid? (Workflow should fail fast with clear error message)
- How does the system handle conflicting configuration values across different sections? (Validation should catch conflicts during configuration loading)
- What happens when a workflow step references a configuration key that doesn't exist? (Should provide default values or fail with descriptive error)
- How does the system handle configuration updates during workflow execution? (Configuration should be immutable once loaded)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **FR-001** | System MUST provide a single configuration file as the authoritative source for all workflow settings |
| **FR-002** | System MUST validate configuration file syntax and required fields on workflow startup |
| **FR-003** | System MUST make configuration values available as environment variables or step inputs throughout the workflow |
| **FR-004** | System MUST support hierarchical configuration with environment-specific overrides |
| **FR-005** | System MUST reduce workflow conditional logic by replacing hardcoded values with configuration references |
| **FR-006** | System MUST provide clear error messages when configuration is invalid or missing required values |
| **FR-007** | System MUST support configuration inheritance and composition for complex scenarios |
| **FR-008** | System MUST allow configuration to be sourced from repository files, secrets, or external sources |
| **FR-009** | System MUST document all available configuration options and their effects on workflow behavior |
| **FR-010** | System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing workflow structures during migration |

### Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **NFR-001** | Configuration loading MUST complete within 10 seconds to avoid workflow delays |
| **NFR-002** | Configuration validation MUST provide actionable error messages for troubleshooting |
| **NFR-003** | System MUST maintain configuration security by not exposing sensitive values in logs |
| **NFR-004** | Configuration changes MUST not require workflow file modifications for routine updates |
| **NFR-005** | System MUST support configuration versioning and rollback capabilities |

### Quality Attributes Addressed

| Attribute | Target Metric |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Maintainability** | Reduce conditional complexity by 60%; single source of truth for all configuration |
| **Reliability** | Configuration validation prevents runtime failures; consistent behavior across environments |
| **Usability** | Clear configuration structure reduces cognitive load for workflow maintainers |
| **Security** | Centralized configuration management with proper secret handling |
| **Efficiency** | Faster workflow updates through configuration changes rather than code modifications |

### Constraints *(include if applicable)*

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **GitHub Actions Environment** | Must work within GitHub Actions workflow syntax and execution model |
| **Configuration Format** | Must support YAML, JSON, or PowerShell data file formats commonly used in workflows |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Must allow gradual migration from existing hardcoded configurations |
| **Repository Structure** | Must integrate with existing PSModule repository conventions |

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Configuration File** | Central YAML/JSON/PSData file containing all workflow settings and parameters |
| **Configuration Schema** | Validation rules defining required and optional configuration properties |
| **Environment Overrides** | Environment-specific configuration values that extend or replace base settings |
| **Configuration Context** | Runtime information (branch, environment, trigger) used to select appropriate configuration |
| **Workflow Parameters** | Derived values from configuration that are passed to workflow steps and jobs |

**Feature Branch**: `001-settings-driven-workflow`
**Created**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Lets make the user story clearer, we want to have a single place to handle configuration and have that help simplify the structure of the rest of the workflow. Aiming to reduce complexity of if: statements in the workflow."

## Execution Flow (main)

1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data is involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
