# Feature Specification: Unified CI and Release Workflow

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a PowerShell module maintainer managing multiple repositories, I need a single workflow configuration that automatically runs tests on pull requests and publishes releases when changes are merged to the main branch. This unified workflow eliminates the need to maintain two separate workflow files (CI.yml and workflow.yml) across all repositories, reducing configuration complexity and ensuring consistency.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a pull request is opened or updated, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** it MUST execute all CI tests without attempting any release operations
2. **Given** a pull request is merged to the main branch, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** it MUST execute CI tests and proceed to release/publish operations if tests pass
3. **Given** changes are pushed directly to the main branch (bypass PR), **When** the workflow runs, **Then** it MUST execute both CI tests and release operations
4. **Given** CI tests fail on a PR, **When** the workflow completes, **Then** it MUST report failure status and NOT proceed to any release operations
5. **Given** CI tests fail on main branch, **When** the workflow completes, **Then** it MUST report failure and halt before release operations
6. **Given** a repository adopts this unified workflow, **When** migration is complete, **Then** maintainers MUST be able to remove separate CI.yml and workflow.yml files without losing functionality

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a workflow is manually triggered (workflow_dispatch)?
- How does the workflow handle concurrent runs when multiple PRs are merged rapidly?
- What happens if release operations fail after CI tests pass on main branch?
- How does the workflow distinguish between testing-only and release-required contexts?
- What happens when a repository has custom test configurations or matrix strategies?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **FR-001** | Workflow MUST trigger on pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened) |
| **FR-002** | Workflow MUST trigger on push events to the main branch |
| **FR-003** | Workflow MUST execute CI test suite for all trigger events |
| **FR-004** | Workflow MUST conditionally execute release operations only on main branch pushes |
| **FR-005** | Workflow MUST skip release operations when running on pull request events |
| **FR-006** | Workflow MUST report test results as PR status checks |
| **FR-007** | Workflow MUST fail fast and halt execution if CI tests fail |
| **FR-008** | Workflow MUST publish module releases to PowerShell Gallery |
| **FR-009** | Workflow MUST create GitHub releases with semantic versioning based on PR labels (major, minor, patch) |
| **FR-010** | Workflow MUST be compatible with existing repository structures used in PSModule repositories |
| **FR-011** | Workflow MUST support manual triggering (workflow_dispatch) with tests-only execution (no release operations) |
| **FR-012** | Workflow MUST handle authentication for PowerShell Gallery publishing via secrets.APIKEY and GitHub Releases via GITHUB_TOKEN |

### Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **NFR-001** | Workflow MUST complete CI test phase using GitHub Actions default timeouts (6 hours per job, 72 hours per workflow; typical completion in 5-15 minutes) |
| **NFR-002** | Workflow MUST be maintainable as a single source of truth across multiple repositories |
| **NFR-003** | Workflow MUST provide clear logging to distinguish CI and release phases |
| **NFR-004** | Workflow MUST be idempotent for release operations (safe to re-run without duplicate publishes) |
| **NFR-005** | Workflow configuration MUST be simple enough for module maintainers to understand and customize |
| **NFR-006** | Workflow MUST minimize redundant work when transitioning from PR to main branch merge |

### Quality Attributes Addressed

| Attribute | Target Metric |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Maintainability** | Single workflow file replaces two separate files; changes apply to all repositories via template updates |
| **Reliability** | Consistent behavior across all trigger scenarios; fail-safe design prevents accidental releases |
| **Usability** | Clear phase separation; easy to understand which operations run in which context |
| **Efficiency** | Reduced configuration overhead; faster onboarding for new repositories |

### Constraints

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Must run on GitHub Actions platform using composite actions or reusable workflows |
| **PowerShell Module Structure** | Must work with PSModule repository structure conventions |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Must not break existing CI or release behaviors when migrating from separate workflows |
| **Existing Actions** | Must leverage existing PSModule GitHub actions (PSModule/GitHub-Script@v1, PSModule/Install-PSModuleHelpers@v1) |

### Key Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Workflow Configuration** | Single YAML file defining triggers, jobs, and conditional logic for CI and release phases |
| **CI Phase** | Test execution, validation, and quality checks that run on all events |
| **Release Phase** | Module publishing, GitHub release creation, and post-release operations that run only on main branch |
| **Trigger Context** | Runtime information determining whether workflow runs in PR mode or release mode |
| **Test Results** | Output from CI phase determining whether release phase can proceed |

**Feature Branch**: `001-merge-ci-release-workflows`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "As a PowerShell module maintainer managing multiple repositories, I need a single workflow configuration that handles both continuous integration testing on pull requests and automated release publishing on merges to the main branch. This eliminates the maintenance burden of keeping two separate workflow files (CI.yml and workflow.yml) synchronized across all my module repositories, reducing configuration complexity and the risk of inconsistencies."
