# Feature Specification: Unified CI/CD Workflow for PowerShell Modules (Breaking Change)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a PowerShell module maintainer managing multiple repositories, I need a single workflow configuration file that automatically runs tests on pull requests and publishes releases when changes are merged to the main branch, so that I can reduce configuration complexity and ensure consistency across all my repositories without maintaining two separate workflow files.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a pull request is opened or updated, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** all tests execute automatically and the PR status reflects the test results
2. **Given** a pull request is merged to the main branch, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** tests execute first, and if passing, the module is automatically published as a release
3. **Given** an existing repository with CI.yml and workflow.yml files, **When** the unified workflow is implemented, **Then** the CI.yml file is deleted (breaking change), and all functionality is consolidated into workflow.yml
4. **Given** a test failure occurs, **When** running on a pull request, **Then** the workflow fails and prevents merge, but when running on main branch after merge, the release is not published
5. **Given** multiple repositories using the unified workflow, **When** configuration changes are needed, **Then** only one workflow file needs to be updated in each repository
6. **Given** automated processes or external systems depending on CI.yml, **When** the unified workflow is deployed, **Then** those processes must be updated to reference workflow.yml instead

### Edge Cases

- What happens when tests pass on PR but fail after merge to main? The release should not be published, and maintainers should be notified
- How does the system handle partial test failures? All tests must pass for releases; any failure prevents publishing
- What happens when the publishing step fails but tests passed? Maintainers must manually re-run the entire workflow (including tests and publish steps)
- How does the workflow differentiate between PR context and main branch context? Conditional logic based on GitHub event triggers determines which steps to execute
- What happens to repositories that have automated processes referencing CI.yml? Maintainers must update all references before deploying the unified workflow
- How are concurrent PR builds isolated to prevent conflicts? Concurrency groups cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed to the same PR or branch

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **FR-001** | Workflow MUST execute all tests automatically when a pull request is opened or updated |
| **FR-002** | Workflow MUST execute all tests automatically when changes are merged to the main branch |
| **FR-003** | Workflow MUST publish a release only when tests pass on the main branch after merge |
| **FR-004** | Workflow MUST prevent release publication if any test fails on the main branch |
| **FR-005** | Workflow MUST consolidate all functionality from both CI.yml and workflow.yml into a single workflow.yml file |
| **FR-006** | Workflow MUST provide clear test results visible in the GitHub PR interface |
| **FR-007** | Workflow MUST support the same test execution capabilities as the existing CI.yml |
| **FR-008** | Workflow MUST support the same release/publish capabilities as the existing workflow.yml |
| **FR-009** | System MUST delete CI.yml file and associated test configurations after migration (breaking change) |
| **FR-010** | Workflow MUST maintain compatibility with existing PowerShell module structure and test frameworks |
| **FR-011** | Migration documentation MUST clearly identify this as a breaking change requiring updates to dependent processes |

### Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **NFR-001** | Workflow MUST complete test execution within reasonable time limits for PR feedback (target: under 10 minutes for typical module) |
| **NFR-002** | Workflow configuration MUST be simple enough to be copied and adapted across multiple repositories |
| **NFR-003** | Workflow MUST provide clear, actionable error messages when tests fail or publishing encounters issues |
| **NFR-004** | Workflow MUST be maintainable by updating a single file rather than coordinating changes across multiple workflow files |
| **NFR-005** | Workflow MUST handle concurrent PR builds without conflicts using concurrency groups that cancel in-progress runs when new commits are pushed |
| **NFR-006** | Workflow MUST rely on GitHub's default notification mechanisms (workflow status, email, UI) for failure alerts; no additional notification systems required |
| **NFR-007** | Workflow MUST use GitHub repository secrets to store API keys for publishing to PowerShell Gallery or other module repositories |

### Quality Attributes Addressed

| Attribute | Target Metric |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Maintainability** | Single workflow file per repository; reduce workflow file count from 2 to 1 |
| **Consistency** | Same test and release behavior across all repositories using this pattern |
| **Reliability** | No releases published without passing tests; clear separation of test and release phases |
| **Usability** | Clear workflow structure that module maintainers can understand and customize |
| **Efficiency** | Reduce duplication of workflow logic across multiple files |

### Constraints *(include if applicable)*

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Must use GitHub Actions as the workflow platform |
| **PowerShell Module Structure** | Must support existing PowerShell module structures with src/, tests/ directories |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Must not break existing test frameworks or module publishing processes |
| **Breaking Change** | Deletion of CI.yml is a breaking change; any external references or automated processes must be updated |
| **Composite Actions** | Must use PSModule workflow composite actions for reusable workflow components |

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pull Request** | GitHub pull request that triggers test execution; status must reflect test results |
| **Main Branch** | Protected branch where merges trigger both tests and release publishing |
| **Test Results** | Outcome of test execution; determines whether workflow succeeds and whether release can be published |
| **Release Artifact** | Published PowerShell module; only created when tests pass on main branch |
| **Workflow Configuration** | Single YAML file containing all CI/CD logic; replaces two separate files |

**Feature Branch**: `001-unified-workflow`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "As a PowerShell module maintainer managing multiple repositories, I need a single workflow configuration that automatically runs tests on pull requests and publishes releases when changes are merged to the main branch. This unified workflow eliminates the need to maintain two separate workflow files (CI.yml and workflow.yml) across all repositories, reducing configuration complexity and ensuring consistency. Delete the CI.yml file and tests when the content is transferred to the workflow.yml."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: When test failures occur on the main branch after merge (preventing release), how should maintainers be notified? → A: No additional notification beyond workflow status
- Q: The spec mentions "allow retry without re-running tests" when publishing fails. How should the retry mechanism work? → A: Manual re-run of entire workflow (re-runs tests + publish)
- Q: What authentication mechanism should the workflow use to publish releases to the PowerShell Gallery (or other module repositories)? → A: GitHub repository secret containing API key
- Q: Which specific GitHub composite actions or reusable workflows does this unified workflow depend on? → A: PSModule workflow composite actions
- Q: How should the workflow handle concurrent PR builds to avoid conflicts (e.g., multiple PRs triggering builds simultaneously)? → A: Use concurrency groups to cancel in-progress runs
