# PR

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

## User input

$ARGUMENTS

**Purpose**: Create or update a pull request with a release note style description and title, automatically applying the appropriate labels based on the change type specified.

## Supported Change Types

| Type | Icon | Labels | Description |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| Major | ðŸŒŸ | `Major` | Breaking changes that affect compatibility |
| Minor | ðŸš€ | `Minor` | New features or enhancements |
| Patch | ðŸ©¹ | `Patch` | Small fixes or improvements |
| Fix | ðŸª² | `Fix`, `Patch` | Bug fixes |
| Docs | ðŸ“– | `Docs` | Documentation changes only |

## Execution Steps

1. **Detect repository mode**:
   - Run `git remote -v` to check configured remotes.
   - **If `upstream` remote exists**: Fork mode - use upstream owner/repo for all GitHub operations
   - **If only `origin` remote exists**: Origin mode - use origin owner/repo for all GitHub operations
   - Parse the URLs to extract owner and repo name: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git`.
   - If in doubt, ask the user to clarify which repository to target.

2. **Determine the change type**:
   1. Parse the user input to identify the change type (Major, Minor, Patch, Fix, or Docs)
   2. If nothing is provided, **analyze ALL changes in the branch** to infer the type:
      - Run `git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only` to get all changed files in the branch
      - Read the diff content using `git diff origin/main...HEAD` to understand the nature of changes
      - Categorize based on ALL changes combined, not just recent commits:
        * **Docs**: ONLY if ALL changes are to documentation files (*.md, docs/, .github/prompts/, etc.) with no code/functionality changes
        * **Fix**: If changes specifically fix bugs without adding new features
        * **Patch**: Small fixes or improvements that do not add new features
        * **Minor**: New features or enhancements that do not break existing functionality
        * **Major**: Changes that break backward compatibility (e.g., removing public APIs, changing method signatures)
      - **Important**: If the branch contains BOTH code changes AND documentation changes, classify based on the code changes, not the documentation
      - **Important**: Check the entire branch diff, not just uncommitted changes or the last commit

3. **Get current branch information**:
   - Determine the current branch name
   - Verify there are changes to commit (if uncommitted changes exist, stage and commit them first)
   - Push the branch to remote if not already pushed.

4. **Retrieve linked issue information** (if available):
   - Attempt to find the GitHub issue number associated with the current branch
   - If found, retrieve the issue title from the target repository
   - Use the issue title as the PR title (with appropriate icon prefix)
   - If no issue is found, ask the user to provide one of the following:
     - the number of the issue to link to the PR
     - if a new issue should be raised for this PR
     - Stop if the user cannot provide either of these.

5. **Generate PR title**:
   - **If issue title retrieved**: Use format `<Icon> <Issue Title>`
   - Examples:
     - `ðŸš€ Add support for custom module templates`
     - `ðŸª² [Fix]: Resolve null reference in parameter validation`
     - `ðŸ“– [Docs]: Update installation guide with prerequisites`

6. **Generate release note style description**:
   - Start with a concise summary paragraph describing **what changes for the user** of the code
   - Focus on user-facing impact, not implementation details
   - Use present tense and active voice
   - Structure:
     * **Leading paragraph**: Clear summary of the change and its benefit to users
     * **If issue linked**: Add `- Fixes #<issue-number>` after the leading paragraph
     * **Optional additional context**: Briefly explain why this change was needed
     * **What's Changed**: Bullet points of key changes (user-facing)
   - Keep it concise - this should read like a release note entry
   - DO NOT add a title or heading before the leading paragraph
   - Avoid implementation details unless necessary for understanding

7. **Create or update the pull request**:
   - **Check if PR already exists** for this branch in the target repository
   - **If PR exists**: Update the title, description, and labels
   - **If PR does not exist**: Create a new PR
   - Set PR to target the default branch (main/master)
   - Open as a **draft PR** (or keep as draft if updating)
   - **Use GitHub MCP tools** to perform these operations:
     ```
     # Create PR (if not exists)
     mcp_github_github_create_pull_request

     # Update PR (if exists)
     mcp_github_github_update_pull_request

     # Add labels to PR
     mcp_github_github_add_labels_to_issue (PRs are issues in GitHub API)
     ```

8. **Apply labels to the PR**:
   - Add the **change type label** based on the type specified (Major, Minor, Patch, Fix, or Docs)
   - For Fix type, add both `Fix` and `Patch` labels
   - If currently in a feature workflow phase (e.g., Planning, Implementation), also apply that phase label
   - Use GitHub MCP to add labels in the target repository

9. **Confirm completion**:
   - Display the PR URL to the user
   - Summarize the PR title, type, and labels applied
   - If in fork mode, remind the user that the PR was created in the upstream repository

**Example Usage**:
- `/PR` - Create a PR for the current changes
- `/PR Minor` - Create a PR for a new feature
- `/PR Fix` - Create a PR for a bug fix
- `/PR Docs` - Create a PR for documentation changes
- `/PR Major` - Create a PR for breaking changes
- `/PR Patch` - Create a PR for small improvements

**Notes**:
- This command commits and pushes changes if there are uncommitted changes
- The PR is always created as a draft to allow for review before marking as ready
- Labels can be manually adjusted after PR creation if needed
- The description should be written from the user's perspective, focusing on impact not implementation
